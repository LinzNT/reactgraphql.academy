                      This time a deep-dive into GraphQL and serverless with
                      Hasura.io, free and open source engine lead by Vladimir
                      Novick.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                      We will learn not only how to create our own GraphQL API
                      and consume it in our Frontend apps, but also how to
                      create serverless business logic and even combine various
                      GraphQL servers together.
                    </P>
                    <P>

                      author, host of the 3factorRadio podcast, and OSS

                      Vladimir brings years of experience with the JavaScript
                      ecosystem and has been coding through the rise of the web.
                      Currently, Vladimir works with Web, Mobile, VR, AR, and
                      IoT technologies and advocates the use of GraphQL and
                      serverless architectures as well as functional languages
                      such as ReasonML.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                      The format will be around 2.5 hours of talk and live
                      coding with half an hour break in between. There'll also
                      be 1 or 2 lightning talks at the beginning.
                    </P>
