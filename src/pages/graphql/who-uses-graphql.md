You may know [what GraphQL is](/graphql/what-is-GraphQL-used-for/) and why it’s so useful, but if you’re yet to be convinced of this syntax’s capabilities you need only look at some of the big names that are already using it - and making a success of it!

## Facebook <a name="facebook"></a>

Seeing as GraphQL is all about helping you use your data better, it should come as little surprise to find out who actually created GraphQL: Facebook.

The social media giant created GraphQL way back in 2012 to help it use data more efficiently by reducing the number of times apps have to call back to the server. Using GraphQL has helped Facebook to build evermore complicated apps that are faster and more efficient than anything they built before. Once they open-sourced it, everyone jumped on the bandwagon.

## Twitter <a name="twitter"></a>

If Facebook could benefit by refining its data use with GraphQL, surely Twitter would be able to as well. Although they started off small, deploying GraphQL to Tweetdeck and Twitter Lite first, Twitter soon deployed GraphQL to its Android and iOS apps as well.

But this wasn’t without its headaches. Twitter had to find a way to limit the depth of queries to stop overly expensive queries being sent to the server. But overall the adoption of GraphQL has been a huge success.

## New York Times <a name="new-york-times"></a>

For the team at the New York Times, having a simpler code base with a single page of documentation was a major aim of their website redesign. They wanted to use GraphQL (and React) to make it so any developer could walk into the office and start building apps from day one, all because the documentation was so streamlined.

GraphQL helped make this a reality. But it hasn’t just made it easier behind-the-scenes at the NYT. Optimised query requests using GraphQL have made the app faster and more efficient for users too!

## Hudl <a name="hudl"></a>

Hudl is a platform for helping coaches and athletes analyse their performance using video analysis. It’s really cool, but Hudl’s customers aren’t the only ones that have a lot of data to sift through. Internally, Hudl has a lot of data to handle. From its account management, sales, support and business development teams all work in different systems that have to communicate and are updated multiple times a day.

![image alt text](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fwho-uses-graphql%2Fimage_4.jpg?alt=media&)

GraphQL helps to generate more effective API documentation so its developers don’t have to spend resource time creating documentation. Now, Hudl has managed to make sure its front-end can interact with all data sources using just one language. The code is way easier to maintain and performance has improved dramatically.

## Github <a name="github"></a>

No list of GraphQL users would be complete without mentioning Github. The go-to developer platform started using GraphQL because there was just no flexibility with older REST APIs.

They always received too much irrelevant data, but GraphQL has fixed that. Github now uses GraphQL on both its front- and back-end.

## In summary, these platforms use GraphQL…

- [Facebook](#facebook)

- [Twitter](#twitter)

- [New York Times](#new-york-times)

- [Hudl](#hudl)

- [Github](#github)
