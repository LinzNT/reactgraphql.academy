Let’s start by questioning some design principles that have dominated the way we’ve styled websites for the last few decades.

## Separation of concerns <a name="front-tend-old-school-separation-of-concerns"></a>

We are not going to question separation of concerns, we think it’s a great design principle. We are going to question the way we have interpreted it for many years in front-end applications. Hopefully, you’ll agree on the new angle from which we look at it.

The following image illustrates how we previously separated the concerns in the front-end:

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fseparation-of-concerns-min.png?alt=media" alt="Old separation of concerns approach in front-end development "></img>

One of the most amazing examples of this separation that I’ve seen is CSS Zen Garden. With various designs based on the **same HTML** and one stylesheet targeting the HTML elements, by applying **different CSS** to them, we can create completely different websites.

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fzen-garden-min.png?alt=media" alt="CSS Zen Garden"></img>

You can visit [http://www.csszengarden.com/](http://www.csszengarden.com/), check some designs, and compare the HTML of some. You’ll see that the only line that changes is the one that imports the CSS. Impressive from the CSS and HTML separation of concerns point of view.

## Global styles <a name="global-styles"></a>

One of the problems you might have with the previous way of separating concerns is maintainability of the code base. In the following example, you can see how a button is styled differently using rules based on sign-up, btn-facebook, chart-view, search, etc. The example is probably very extreme, but it makes the point.

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fcss-hell-min.png?alt=media" alt="CSS hell"></img>

## Choosing the right concern <a name="choosing-the-right-concern"></a>

Separating concerns is good, but we need to choose the right concerns. For many years the norm was to separate things based on some technical aspect, like CSS, JS, HTML, views, controllers, etc. In this “old” approach when you look at the source code of a project you see things like the following:

```
/src/css/index.css
/src/css/button.css
/src/css/alert.css
/src/css/…css
/src/views/alert.html
…
/src/controllers/alert.js
…
```

CSS, controllers, views, etc, are implementation details. If you think of the user or the business, they don’t use techie words like CSS, JS, etc, they say “checkout”, “message”, “button”, etc. These are the first concerns we should think of. Then, of course, each “message” or “button” will have different technical aspects depending on the implementation.

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Falert-button-component-min.png?alt=media" alt="Button and Alert component with CSS co-located"></img>

As the following image illustrates we are still separating concerns, but we have given a **different angle** to the definition.

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fsep-concerns-diff-angle-min.png?alt=media" alt="Separation on concerns from a different angle"></img>

Change is the only constant, therefore it's good to [revise our concerns](#front-tend-old-school-separation-of-concerns) from time to time.

## create-react-app

If you have used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) you’ve seen that it creates a separate file for App.js and for App.css, and for index.js and index.css. Do you think create-react-app promotes separating the concerns in a way that is easier to maintain our code?

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fcreate-react-app-min.png?alt=media" alt="Create React App css  approach"></img>

I think it does. It follows the co-location principle, it co-locates the JS and the CSS close. Note, we also apply the co-location principle in React Router and GraphQL for instance.

So, are we done with styling? Well, there is another issue created by global styles. That folder structure separates the code by concern, but nothing stops us from creating an “active” class in Button.css, and an “active” class in Alert.css with different values. What do you think it’s going to happen if we have an active button and an active alert in the same view?

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fcollision-min.png?alt=media" alt="CSS collision"></img>

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fblue-or-orange-min.png?alt=media" alt="Blue button or orange button?"></img>

## Naming conventions

The solution to the style collision is to use name conventions in our CSS classes. There are different conventions. The problem with name conventions is that humans must implement them. That’s more work, and it’s error-prone.

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fnaming-conventions-min.png?alt=media" alt="CSS naming conventions"></img>

A better approach is to automate that CSS naming. You can use CSS modules for this:

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fcss-modules-min.png?alt=media" alt="CSS modules"></img>

[css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) is the loader that makes CSS modules work. css-loader is installed and configured by default when using create-react-app.

## Styled-components <a name="styled-components"></a>

[Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) is the library we use at LeanJS to style our React components. Why? A single library that solves elegantly all the problems I’ve mentioned.

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fstyled-components-check-list-min.png?alt=media" alt="Styled-components features"></img>

The [documentation of styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs) is great, very clear and with good examples. So there is not much we can add in this post that is not already well explained in the official docs.

However, let me point out one feature that is quite important and I don’t want you to miss if you are new to React. Styled-components, apart from solving all the problems we’ve mentioned, does something that SASS, LESS, BIM, SMACSS, and other approaches can’t do. Styled-components has conditional rendering. This means it can decide a style at render time based on some props. That’s very powerful and you should definitely leverage this feature.

The following image shows a button with conditional rendering based on a prop called “primary”. Depending on the value of “primary” it will render a different style.

```.jsx-inline
const Button = styled.button`
  /* Adapt the colors based on primary prop */
  background: ${props => props.primary ?
    "palevioletred" : "white"
  };
  color: ${props => props.primary ?
    "white" : "palevioletred"};

  font-size: 1em;
  margin: 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
`;

render(
  <div>
    <Button>Normal</Button>
    <Button primary>Primary</Button>
  </div>
);
```

You can edit the previous code by removing 'primary' from the last button. The style will react and change the color.

### CSS optimization <a name="css-optimization"></a>

Another amazing feature you get from using styled-components is that it will only generate the CSS required for a given page. The way it works is the following, when React traverses the tree rendering components, styled-components adds to the head of the page the `<style>` tag containing only the CSS of the components that were rendered. This works very well on server-side rendering or static site generators like Gatsbyjs, so it optimizes the first page load by reducing the CSS load.

This website uses styled-components, so you can see an example of the CSS injected by looking at the `<head>` in the source code of this page.

<img placeholder-height="px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reactjsacademy-react.appspot.com/o/blog%20post%20images%2Fstyling%2Fstyled-components-head-min.png?alt=media" alt="styled-components head page"></img>

## Components everywhere <a name="components-everywhere"></a>

Everything on the UI can be a component (including the metas in the head! when we say everything it means everything :). Therefore you can define all your styles using styled-components. That means no need for SASS, LESS, or other CSS pre-processors.

You can see an example in the ReactJS Academy website, where **EVERYTHING is a component**:

- [Some basic components](https://github.com/reactjsacademy/reactjsacademy/tree/master/src/components/text)
- [Default page layout](https://github.com/reactjsacademy/reactjsacademy/blob/master/src/layouts/index.js)
- [Home page](https://github.com/reactjsacademy/reactjsacademy/blob/master/src/pages/index.js)

That being said, I often see that many new developers to React that are used to the "old .css" find it very difficult to only use component based styles. Common cases they mention:

- They want font colours and sizes in SASS or LESS variables. If you use component based styles those colours, fonts, etc become [simple JavaScript variables](https://github.com/reactjsacademy/reactjsacademy/blob/master/src/config/styles.js).
- Styling "default/ generic" h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p…. No problem, they can also be [components](https://github.com/reactjsacademy/reactjsacademy/tree/master/src/components/text).
- Default paddings and margins. You can elegantly solve it by using [themings](https://github.com/reactjsacademy/reactjsacademy/blob/master/src/layouts/index.js#L24).

As you can see, in all those cases we can use a component, and so you can co-locate the style in that component. I know, it might not look that obvious at the beginning, especially if you are very used to SASS, LESS, or “classic” CSS.

## Pro-tip <a name="pro-tip"></a>

Add a global and generic CSS like [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to remove all the custom browser styling (paddings, margins, etc). Then use only styled-components to style your app.

If you really think you need to create a separate SASS or LESS file and you need to define variables there, you can export those variables to JavaScript using CSS Modules so you don’t have to define them twice. For instance variables for colors. You can see an [example here](https://github.com/reactjsacademy/fb-messenger/blob/styling-in-react-leanjs/src/styles/export/colours.scss).

## Conclusion

- [Separate your CSS concerns in a way](#choosing-the-right-concern) that makes it easier to maintain and reuse your code by co-locating the CSS and JS of your components.
- [Styled-components](#styled-components) will help you easily style any React component and avoid common CSS pitfalls.
- In React everything can be a component. [Components everywhere!](#components-everywhere)
- Avoid [global styles](#global-styles) as they can create side effects that are difficult to predict and fix. Everything can be a component, therefore you don’t need any global CSS.
- If you find that you really need to create some global CSS and [include variables](#pro-tip) using SASS or LESS, you can share those variables between CSS and JavaScript using CSS modules
